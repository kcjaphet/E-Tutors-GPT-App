# Security Implementation Guide

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets Removed ✅
- Removed hardcoded MongoDB URI from `config/env.js` and `config/db.js`
- Removed hardcoded Stripe secret key from `config/stripe.js`
- Cleaned up exposed API keys from `.env.example`
- All secrets now must be provided via environment variables

### 2. JWT Security Enhanced ✅
- Removed insecure 'default_jwt_secret' fallback
- JWT_SECRET is now required environment variable
- Added startup validation to ensure JWT_SECRET is set
- Proper error handling for missing JWT secrets

### 3. Password Reset Security Fixed ✅
- Removed debug information exposure from password reset responses
- Removed console.log statements that exposed reset tokens
- Implemented proper rate limiting for password reset attempts

### 4. Input Validation Implemented ✅
- Added comprehensive email format validation
- Implemented strong password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Added text input sanitization and length limits
- Implemented XSS prevention measures
- Added NoSQL injection protection

### 5. Authentication & Authorization Strengthened ✅
- Added authentication middleware to all protected payment routes
- Implemented rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Added proper user session management
- Enhanced request validation and sanitization

### 6. Security Headers and CORS Hardening ✅
- Implemented Helmet.js for security headers
- Added Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented restrictive CORS policy with specific allowed origins
- Added comprehensive rate limiting

### 7. Error Handling Improvements ✅
- Implemented secure error responses that don't leak system information
- Added proper exception handling across all routes
- Removed sensitive information from error messages

## Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables are now **required** and the application will not start without them:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key (if using Stripe)
```

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### Rate Limiting
- Authentication routes: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- Password reset: 3 attempts per hour
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### Input Validation
- All inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Email format validation using industry-standard patterns
- Text length limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- XSS protection enabled
- Clickjacking protection via X-Frame-Options
- MIME sniffing protection

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set strong, unique JWT_SECRET (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Configure proper MongoDB connection with authentication
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins (remove wildcards)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures

## Security Monitoring

- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track rate limit violations
- Log suspicious activity patterns
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
