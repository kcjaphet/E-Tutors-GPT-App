# GPTTextTools Backend API

This is the backend API for GPTTextTools, providing endpoints for AI text detection and text humanization.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   # Add any API keys here when integrating with actual AI detection services
   # GPTZERO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Detect AI Text
- **URL**: `/api/detect-ai-text`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "The text you want to analyze"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "aiProbability": 75.5,
      "confidenceLevel": "High",
      "analysis": "This text was likely generated by AI...",
      "textLength": 150,
      "timestamp": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```

## Integration with Real AI Detection Services

In a production environment, you would want to replace the placeholder detection service with actual API calls to services like GPTZero, OpenAI, or other specialized AI detection tools.
